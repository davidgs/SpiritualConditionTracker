/var/www/vhosts/spiritual-condition.com/httpdocs/SpiritualConditionTracker/node_modules/minimatch/dist/commonjs/index.js is treated as an ES module file as it is a .js file whose nearest parent package.json contains "type": "module" which declares all .js files in that package scope as ES modules.
Instead either rename /var/www/vhosts/spiritual-condition.com/httpdocs/SpiritualConditionTracker/node_modules/minimatch/dist/commonjs/index.js to end in .cjs, change the requiring code to use dynamic import() which is available in all CommonJS modules, or change "type": "module" to "type": "commonjs" in /var/www/vhosts/spiritual-condition.com/httpdocs/SpiritualConditionTracker/node_modules/minimatch/package.json to treat all .js files as CommonJS (using .mjs for all ES modules instead).

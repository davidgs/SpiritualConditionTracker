Next steps:
1. Open the Xcode workspace at: /Users/davidgs/github.com/SpiritualConditionTracker/expo-app/ios/SpiritualConditionTracker.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace
2. Select your team in Signing & Capabilities
3. Run the app on a simulator or device

Troubleshooting:
If you get 'No script URL provided' error:
- Make sure the JavaScript bundle was generated in ios/assets/main.jsbundle
- Verify AppDelegate.m is configured to use the embedded bundle
- Check that the bundle is included in the Xcode project (Add files to project if needed)

For other issues:
- Check the console logs in Xcode for more specific error messages
- Make sure all native dependencies are properly linked
- Verify that the SQLite storage module is properly configured

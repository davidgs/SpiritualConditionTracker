# ðŸš¨ BREAKING CHANGE: Unified People + Contacts Architecture

## For Beta Testers - Action Required

**This update requires deleting the app and all data before installing the new version.**

### Why This Breaking Change?

We've completely restructured the database to eliminate data duplication and create a professional-grade contact management system with:

- **Unified Address Book**: All contacts (sponsors, sponsees, AA members, friends) in one place
- **Complete Contact History**: Full interaction timeline per person
- **Simplified Architecture**: No more duplicate contact information across multiple tables
- **Future-Ready**: Easy to add new contact types without schema changes

### Migration Steps for Beta Testers

1. **Backup Important Data** (Optional)
   - Take screenshots of any important contact information
   - Note sobriety dates and important notes

2. **Delete Current App**
   - Delete the app from your device completely
   - This removes all local database files

3. **Install New Version**
   - Install the new version from TestFlight
   - App will start with clean unified database

4. **Re-enter Data**
   - Use the new Address Book feature to add contacts
   - Contacts can now be properly categorized (sponsor, sponsee, member, friend, family)
   - All interaction history will be properly tracked

### New Features Enabled

#### Address Book
- **Unified Contact List**: All recovery community contacts in one place
- **Rich Contact Info**: Name, phone, email, sobriety date, home group
- **Relationship Types**: Sponsor, sponsee, member, friend, family, professional
- **Search & Filter**: Find contacts by name, relationship, or home group

#### Enhanced Contact Tracking
- **Complete History**: Full timeline of all interactions per person
- **Contact Types**: Call, meeting, coffee, text, service work
- **Rich Context**: "Called John S. (Sponsor)" instead of generic entries
- **Action Item Integration**: Link action items directly to people/contacts

#### Simplified Data Model
- **No Duplication**: Contact info stored once per person
- **Better Performance**: Faster queries and reduced storage
- **Cleaner Code**: Easier to maintain and extend

### Data Architecture Benefits

**Before (Complex)**:
- `sponsor_contacts` table
- `sponsee_contacts` table  
- `sponsors` table with duplicate contact info
- `sponsees` table with duplicate contact info
- `action_items` with multiple foreign keys

**After (Clean)**:
- `people` table (unified address book)
- `contacts` table (interaction records)
- `sponsors` table (just relationship metadata)
- `sponsees` table (just relationship metadata)
- `action_items` with simple person/contact references

### Testing Focus Areas

1. **Address Book Management**
   - Add contacts with different relationship types
   - Search and filter contacts

2. **Contact Recording**

3. **Sponsor/Sponsee Features**

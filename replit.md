# Spiritual Condition Tracker - Replit Development Guide

## Overview

The Spiritual Condition Tracker is a comprehensive mobile application designed for individuals in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) recovery programs. It provides tools for tracking spiritual activities, managing sponsor/sponsee relationships, monitoring meetings, and calculating spiritual fitness scores based on recovery activities.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 19.1.0 with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Material-UI (MUI) v7.1.1 with custom theming
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming
- **Bundle Management**: Webpack with code splitting and lazy loading
- **Performance**: Lazy-loaded components (Dashboard, Meetings, Profile, SponsorSponsee)

### Backend Architecture
- **Database**: SQLite with Capacitor SQLite plugin for mobile
- **Data Layer**: Centralized DatabaseService with proper initialization and error handling
- **State Management**: React Context API (AppDataContext) for global state
- **Services**: Dedicated service classes for database operations

### Mobile Platform Support
- **iOS**: Full Capacitor integration with Xcode project configuration
- **Android**: Capacitor support with Android-specific configurations
- **Development**: Webpack build only - no web deployment (iOS-only app)

## Key Components

## Data Flow

### Data Architecture
1. **Single User App**: Designed for personal use with one primary user
2. **Activity Tracking**: All recovery activities stored in centralized activities table
3. **Relationship Management**: Separate tables for sponsors and sponsees with contact tracking
4. **Action Items**: Unified action item system with sponsor/sponsee associations
5. **Spiritual Fitness**: Algorithmic calculation based on activity frequency and type

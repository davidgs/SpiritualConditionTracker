# Podfile Simplification Guide

After extensive trial and error with the iOS build, I've created a simpler approach that focuses on getting a working build rather than trying complex solutions.

## The Problem

The iOS build has been failing with:
- Missing ReactAppDependencyProvider podspec
- Issues with React-Fabric and other new architecture components

## The Solution

I've created a simplified Podfile that:

1. Uses a bare minimum configuration
2. Explicitly disables all new architecture features
3. Skips problematic targets completely
4. Doesn't try any clever tricks or advanced Ruby code

## How to Use

1. Run the simplification script:
   ```
   cd expo-app
   ./fix-podfile-simple.sh
   ```

2. Install pods:
   ```
   cd ios
   pod install
   ```

3. Try a local iOS build:
   ```
   cd ..
   npx expo run:ios
   ```

## Why This Works

- The simplified Podfile contains the minimal necessary configuration
- It completely disables all new architecture components
- It sets the EXCLUDED_ARCHS for problematic targets
- It uses a standard post_install hook without any fancy manipulations

If this works locally, you can then try:
```
eas build --platform ios --profile preview --local
```

This builds locally rather than on EAS servers, avoiding deployment limits and giving you direct access to logs.

## If Problems Persist

If you still encounter issues, consider:

1. Checking Xcode's actual logs rather than EAS's summary
2. Using `--local` to build locally and debug more effectively 
3. Checking for specific error messages about dependency conflicts
